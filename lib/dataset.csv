 Only products manufactured before February 2008 are affected by this recall.
 
 How to identify the product
 
 The controller is part of the inner workings of the spa and will be found behind the spa's cabinet or under decking adjacent to the spa. The exact location of the controller will vary depending on the spa design. The simplest way to identify whether a spa is affected by this recall is to look at the spa's touchpad design. Spas with touchpads similar to those in these photographs may contain an affected controller. If unsure, consumers can email a photograph of their spa touchpad to SpaQuipRecall@davey.com.au(link sends email) and a team member will confirm if it is an affected spa.
 
  
 
  See a list of details to help identify the product.","The controller has a flexible socket, which means it is possible for an AMP plug to be forced into the controller upside-down. This may cause the plugged-in device or parts touching the plugged-in device to become live.","Risk of electric shock, which can cause serious injury or death.","If affected, consumers should disconnect / isolate, and stop using the spa. Do not undertake any repairs or connect any new devices to the spa and contact Davey Water Products to arrange for a free replacement controller to be fitted to the spa by a certified technician, free of charge.For more information, contact Davey Water Products on 1300 232 839 (9am to 5pm AEST, Monday to Friday), email SpaQuipRecall@davey.com.au(link sends email), or contact your local Davey pool equipment dealer.",Davey Water Products Pty Ltd(link is external),Davey Water Products Pty Ltd(link is external),https://www.daveywater.com/,"Spa manufacturers, retailers and service centres","2 November 2005

Infant/Pediatric EFS Calibration Pressure Increase
 
 Potential for inappropriate therapy to be provided when the EFS is used with manual calibration, increasing the risk of serious health complications including:
 
 - Barotrauma (an injury to the lungs because of too much pressure)
 
 - Hypotension (a decrease in blood pressure)
 
 - Hypercarbia (too much carbon dioxide in the blood)","Philips will be releasing a software correction for this issue. Philips will be contacting customers when the software is released. In the interim, customers are advised to refer to the steps provided in the Customer Letter (supplied to impacted users by Philips) until the updated software is installed on the device.Infant/Pediatric EFS Calibration Pressure Increase
 
 If you are using the infant/pediatric EFS, do not perform a manual circuit calibration. Instead, use the default calibration. The pressure increase will not occur if the default circuit calibration is used. Pressure Drift (Continuous Usage)
 
 If a pressure drift is detected, the decision to reset the device and return to its original, intended settings MUST be made in consultation with a clinician. Take steps to support the patient during a brief interruption in therapy, as needed. For further information, consumers should contact Philips Customer Care Centre by phone on

 During high battery usage, the pumps displayed battery life may appear to fluctuate. For example during a basal or bolus delivery, the displayed battery life may temporarily decrease, but normalises to display a higher value once insulin delivery is completed. This may be confusing to users.
 
 
 The fluctuating battery life display does not affect insulin delivery, and the pump will continue delivering insulin as long as there is at least 1% of battery remaining.",,"The issue will be rectified via a software update (Version 6.4.1) by the end of 2020 that resolves the potential fluctuating battery life display. AMSL Diabetes Customer Care will contact consumers to complete the free remote update of their insulin pump when the software update becomes available.
 
 
 Consumers are requested to adhere to the following precautions, until this software update is available, to ensure that their pump is properly charged, and the pump’s battery life does not fall below 25% remaining power: 
 
 1. Periodically check the battery level indicator of your pump;
 
 2. Charge the pump for a short period of time every day (10 to 15 minutes);
 
 3. Avoid full battery discharges.
 
 The fluctuating battery life display will generally resolve itself on its own after 30 minutes. Charging the pump battery for 30 minutes will also help to resolve the issue.
